# Botany 2015 presentation

## Estimating allele frequencies in non-model polyploids using high throughput sequencing data

The presentation is in the file pblischak_botany2015talk.pdf. I made the presentation using **LaTeX** and **beamer**. 

### `doc/`

The .tex file for the presentation can be found here. It can be compiled and repoduced by cloning this repo and typing `make`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pblischak/botany2015.git
cd botany2015talk
make
```

### `fig/`

These are the raw pieces of the figures as well as the code to generate them. I used **Inkscape** to do all of the figure manipulations.
