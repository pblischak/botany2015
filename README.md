# Botany 2015 presentation

## Estimating allele frequencies in non-model polyploids using
throughput sequencing data

The presentation is in the file pblischak_botany2015talk.pdf. I made the presentation using **LaTeX** and **beamer**. 

### `doc/`

All of the TeX files for putting together the presentation are here. The finalized figures are in the `figures/`.

### `fig/`

These are the raw pieces of the figures as well as the code to generate them. I used **Inkscape** to do all of the figure manipulations.
